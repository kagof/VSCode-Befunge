# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the VSCode Befunge extension! Please read, understand, and agree to the following before making your contribution.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Bug Reports

Please make sure all bug reports have not already been reported or fixed, and come with a clear description of the situation, effect, expected experience, and, if at all possible, steps to reproduce the bug.

### Feature Requests

Please make sure all feature requests are clear, concise, feasible, useful, and not already implemented or requested.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests for bugs or features are encouraged, but please open an issue first and ensure it has been discussed & approved. Your code will be reviewed as soon as possible; please be willing to accept feedback & and change your pull request as needed.

This project uses TSLint to ensure consistent code style, adapted from the AirBnB code style. Please make sure any contributions match this. You can check whether your code matches this style by running `npm install && npm run lint`.

Make sure the tests pass by using the `npm test` command, and consider adding a new test if appropriate, especially if your PR is a bugfix.

Also ensure that the extension still runs properly after your changes, by using the built in extension debugger in VS Code.

Ideally, we'd like to work with a branch-per-issue policy, as well as a one-commit-per-issue policy. Feel free to make a separate commit when addressing code review comments, or to amend your existing commit. If a new commit is made, it will be squashed into the original before merging.

Preferably you should be using signed commits, although this is not required.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at karl \[dot\] goffin \[at\] gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
